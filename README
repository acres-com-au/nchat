Run make to compile.  To start the server, execute ./src/server/ncServer from the terminal.  Start the client by
executing ./src/client/ncClient from the terminal.

The Makefile and files it includes are all very primitive.  I would like to set up a system that uses autotools, but I
don't know how to use them yet.
